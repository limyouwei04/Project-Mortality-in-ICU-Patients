# Project-Mortality-in-ICU-Patients
This project uses the data from the PhysioNet Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2012. The dataset contains 12,000 ICU stays, for which data from the first 48 hours of the ICU stay are recorded. This project aims to develop a model prototype that can predict mortality of ICU patients.
